# coffee-react-karma-webpack-phantomjs
An example project with React, CJSX, Webpack, Karma and a testsuite that runs in PhantomJS

# Background
For @Hacker0x01 I was researching frontend testing frameworks, and so I decided to setup a test project to test if our stack would run.

Therefor this project is mostly focussed on getting the test-suite running, and there is nothing in place to build a bundle.js for use outside of tests. If you're interested in this setup, please let me know by opening an issue, and I'll see what I can do!

# Setup
Run `npm install`, followed by `npm test`.
